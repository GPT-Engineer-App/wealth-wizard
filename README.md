Creating your financial analysis web-based platform involves a series of technical decisions and planning across both the front-end and back-end aspects. Here's a detailed breakdown of what you would need:

Front-end Requirements:
User Interface (UI) Design:
Client User Interface: Clean, user-friendly interface for selecting banks, viewing charts, and accessing updated data. Incorporate bank logos next to each chart.
Advisor Dashboard: Interface for uploading data (CSV files), bank logos, and managing uploaded data. Include feedback mechanisms that confirm successful uploads or errors.
Interactive Components:
Dropdown menus for selecting banks.
Date pickers for selecting ranges for analysis (if needed).
Dynamic charts that update based on selected data.
Technologies:
Frameworks: React.js or Angular for building a dynamic and responsive interface.
Libraries: D3.js or Chart.js for creating interactive charts.
CSS Frameworks: Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
Back-end Requirements:
Database:
Type: Relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) due to the structured nature of financial data and the need for complex queries.
Schema Design: Tables for users, banks, financial metrics, and logs of data uploads.
Data Handling:
API to handle requests from the front-end (CRUD operations on the database).
Secure file upload mechanisms for CSV files.
Data parsing and validation before storing in the database.
